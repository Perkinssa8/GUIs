        <p>The html provides a rich user interface input/output </p>
        <p>This applies to not only html, but anything that you put on the screen, like desktop apps</p>
        <span>Name:<input type = "text"/></span>
        <div>
            I am in a div, it gets its own line in the doc
        </div>
        <new>Does this create a new line</new>
        <span id="kabob-case-span-1">I am Span 1</span>
        <button id="button-1" name="button-2">Click me</button>
        <span>I am Span 2 which doesn't create a new line</span>
        <input type="text"/>
        <p>notice the forward slash in the code to make a self closing tag</p>
        <p>input tags don't have any valid children, it includes types like text, file (upload), password (hidden)</p>
        <span> email, (tell browser autofill), radiobuttons, checkboxes, range, slider, number, etc.</span>
